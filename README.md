# Generative AI in Finance — Predicting, Preventing, and Profiting with Python

## Overview
This project accompanies the Medium article **“Generative AI in Finance — Predicting, Preventing, and Profiting with Python”**, which explores how **Generative AI** is transforming the finance industry through synthetic data generation, anomaly detection, and predictive modeling.  

It includes **Python visualization scripts** and examples that demonstrate how generative models (like Variational Autoencoders and GANs) can create realistic financial time series data for model training and stress testing.
